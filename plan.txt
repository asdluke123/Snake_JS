Create my board out of a number of divs wrapped in a section flex container in direction row wrapping. 

Create a object to track wins and current score and applePlace . 

Then I would create event listeners for each of the arrow keys to run functions off of press. 

 I would create an array for my snake for the head,body and tail. 
 
 The snake moves in a forward based on what key the user presses. 
 
 When the snake goes over an apple push a new tail and change the old tail to a body. 
 
 Create methods for logic where we collide into a wall or collide into ourself. (edited)
