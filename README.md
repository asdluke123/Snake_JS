# My Rendition of Everyones Faviorite Game-Snake 

## Description 
### This is my rendetion of creating the popular online game Snake!! I played it all the time as a kid always trying to beat my high-score and always wondered how this game was made. SO for my first project at bootcamp I knew I had to try and recreate snake.I was able to make my rendition of Snake within a week after learning Javascript in-depth for a week.



## How to get started
